# Maze Generator and Solver

This project implements a maze generator and solver in Python, utilizing various algorithms for maze generation and basic graph traversal for pathfinding. The project includes features for generating both rectangular and irregular mazes, as well as visualizing the maze-solving process interactively.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**:
  - Rectangular maze generation using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm.
  - Irregular maze generation using Voronoi tessellation.
  
- **Maze Solving**:
  - Pathfinding using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from start to end in the maze.

- **Visualization**:
  - Interactive visualization of maze generation and solving using `matplotlib` and `ipywidgets`.
  - Real-time animation of maze-solving process.
 
## Additional Notes

- Feel free to modify and extend the project according to your needs.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
